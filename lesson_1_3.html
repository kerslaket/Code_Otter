			<h3>Creating A New Python File</h3>
			
			<p>First open IDLE and go to file and select new file to open a blank python file in IDLE. 
			<br><br><img class = "lessonIMG" src = "lesson_images/section0/image3_1.png"><br><br>
			</p>
			
			<h3>Writing Your First Program</h3>
			
			<p>In the open IDLE window start by typing the word print. IDLE will highlight this word purple 
			since it is what is known as a reserved word. A reserved word is a word that already has a meaning 
			in python that can’t be reassigned. We will expand on this later when we discuss variables. A Print 
			statement takes whatever is placed between two brackets and outputs it in the shell. The value placed 
			in the brackets is referred to as an “argument”. Any argument could be an number, or a string of text. 
			Feel free to enter whatever you want in the brackets as long as its between two quotation marks, like in the
			example below. IDLE highlights strings in green text so you can easily identify whether you have done this correctly.
			<br><br><img class = "lessonIMG" src = "lesson_images/section0/image3_2.png"><br><br>
			Now save this file as any name you want, something like firstprogram.py . Now go to the Run menu option and select Run Module,
			or press f5. This will begin running and interpreting your program in Shell.
			<br><br><img class = "lessonIMG" src = "lesson_images/section0/image3_3.png"><br><br>
			<br><br><img class = "lessonIMG" src = "lesson_images/section0/image3_4.png"><br><br>
			Now go back to your file and change the string inside the green text to anything else you want and save and run the program again. 
			Notice how the text changes. 
			<br><br><img class = "lessonIMG" src = "lesson_images/section0/image3_5.png"><br><br>
			You can even remove the quotation marks and enter just a number by itself. Try this and notice how it outputs the number in a similar
			fashion to the text but does not require quotation marks. That's because python recognises numbers as their relative data types and knows
		    how to treat them in this context. Now try and enter some text without enclosing the string with quotation marks and then saving and
			running then program. 
			<br><br><img class = "lessonIMG" src = "lesson_images/section0/image3_6.png"><br><br>
			You should receive an error similar to this. This is because without the quotation marks the interpreter doesn’t know to treat the text 
			as a string data type as cant pass it as an argument into the print function.
			</p>

			<p>
			Congratulations! In this lesson you’ve created your first program in python, although very simple the print function is something 
			you will get very familiar with as we get to grips with more advanced topics like data types, loops, variables, and if statements
			as these tutorials progress. Feel free to play around with the print function more or move straight on to the next set of lessons.
			</p>
