			<h1>Initial Research</h1>
			
			<p>
				There’s going to be a piece of homework for every module comprising of a mixture of research tasks, practical exercises, and larger projects. This first piece of homework is simply research based and allows you to do some further reading into certain topics that have been briefly mentioned so far, some articles detailing why you should learn programming and python, and some inspirational material.

			</p>

			<h3>Task 1 - What Is An IDE?</h3>

			<p>
				We mentioned ide’s in a lesson this module (IDLE is an ide) but didn’t go into too much detail. This bbc article expands on it and is definitely worth reading over and understanding if you don’t already know what an ide is.
			</p>

			<h3>Task 2 - Interpreters VS Compilers: Fight To The Death</h3>

			<p>
				Again, so far in this course we’ve mentioned interpreters and compilers but didn’t go into too much detail. This web page provides a detailed comparison between the two that’s easy for beginners to understand.

			<h3>Task 3 - Why Programming?</h3>

			<p>
				These next couple of articles may help to give you some inspiration as to why you should learn programming. The first one is a blog post detailing how learning even the simplest python can assist you in whatever field you work in, whether you’re a biologist, a film editor, or a self employed taxidermist overcharging on etsy. There's also a good article detailing why you should learn python over other languages as you may well have heard about other languages being better for whatever reason, and should help provide some clarification as to why python is a great first language to learn. Finally is a link to a post from the learnprogramming subreddit. It provides a detailed timeline of someone who went from nothing, to being an employed programming in less that 2 years learning only on the internet and for completely free.
