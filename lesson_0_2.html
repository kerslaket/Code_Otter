			<h1>Why Python</h1>

			<p>
					So you may be asking, why Python? You may have heard things like Python is slow, Python can’t do all the things that Java and C++ can do, you can’t make anything useful in Python. You might not have ever heard of Python or anything related to programming languages. Well don’t worry, cause I’m gonna explain away all of these misconceptions and why Python is an incredibly powerful language.
			</p>

			<h3>Python is Just as Powerful as Other Languages</h3>

			<p>
					So let's get this out of the way first, some people will try to convince you that Python isn’t a “Real” programming language. These people are wrong. Yes, Python is definitely a little less powerful, and a little less efficient, but it can still do everything these over programming languages to do, usually with no or negligible difference to performance, but with much faster development times since Python is so easy to write. This brings me on to my next point.
			</p>

			<h3>Python is Very Quick and Easy to Write and Learn</h3>

			<p>
					Python as a language makes a few assumptions, and simplifies a lot of things. This means that although you could argue you have slightly less control over your program, and it could be argued it runs slightly slower than an equivalent c++ program, it's so much faster and easier to learn and implement, thus making it easier to learn other programming languages in the future as well as making it quicker and easier to write programs.
			</p>

			<h3>Python is a Highly Employable Programming Language</h3>

			<p>
					Python experience and fluency is not just one of the most sought after skills by employers in the software industry but is also one of the highest salaried skills. This is due to good knowledge of Python results in increased development times and can be used in so many areas of development. Libraries like Django and Flask mean that its one of the most sought after skills in back-end web development and the numpy library is quickly rising against the use of matlab for maths and physics based calculations.
