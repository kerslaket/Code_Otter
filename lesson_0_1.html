					Computers and computer software have taken over the world. Almost every job that exists nowadays requires the use of a computer and everyone interacts with one everyday through the form of desktops, smartphones, and even simple embedded devices such as washing machines. According to the office of national statistics ‘89% of adults in Great Britain used the internet at least weekly in 2018’ (Office for National Statistics, 2018). Computers are the foundation of people's lives, but very few people take up interest in how computer software actually works. This is due to a variety of reasons. Being intimidated,  thinking its way too difficult, thinking they need to attend classes or a university, or simply looking up courses and books and turning away since they seem too technical or advanced. There's thousands of materials online, in libraries, and in schools, some of which work, some of which don’t. I want to find out out which ones do work, why they work, and create the best possible experience for newcomers to the world of programming.

					I believe it would be beneficial for society if more people learned to program. Not only does it teach logical thinking skills but It can help in so many other areas where people use computers as more and more businesses are ‘relying on computer code’ (Dishman, 2016). So many accountants use excel everyday, creating spreadsheets and typing out so many functions that they could probably automate so easily with just the simplest of programming skills. So many call centre employees interact with databases everyday and have to fiddle with poorly implemented UI’s. Imagine how much easier their job would be if they knew how to directly interact with a database using sql commands. Ever needed to create a massive tree of folders for a project and take ages creating and naming each one? Well a video editor for the company TreeHouse used to do this everyday until he learned basic python skills and automated the entire process (McFarland, 2014).

					I remember when I first started learning how to program. I hated it. My IT teacher handed me a 40 page booklet that was poorly written and explained. I had to google almost everything and it made me hate programming. It wasn’t until about 2 years later that I discovered my love for programming when I started to discover online resources that helped me learn things at my own pace and showed me how programming can actually benefit me and make my life easier. Unfortunately many of my classmates were left behind as they found the amount of resources and different approaches to learning too overwhelming. That's why I believe this project will be beneficial as I intend to investigate and test the best approaches to teaching programming and implement them in a simple, user friendly way that will allow people to embrace the idea of learning to program.
